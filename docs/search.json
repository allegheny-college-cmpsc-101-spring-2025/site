Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their ability to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.\nQuantitative Reasoning (QR): Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.\nScientific Process and Knowledge (SP): Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.\n\nPrerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.\nDistribution Requirements: QR, SP."

Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed the work that correctly fulfills the assignment’s specification and submitted it by the deadline.\nEngineering Labs are graded based on gatorgrade scores and other criteria.\n\nFifty percent of the grade of each Engineering Lab is determined by the percentage of gatorgrade checks passed.\nOne quarter of the grade is determined by code correctness following a rubric.\nOne quarter of the grade is determined by professional skills and presentation following a rubric. Professional presentation is impacted by linting, formatting, testing, profiling, duplication avoidance, commenting, markdown styling and communication in reflections.\n\nSpec Labs are graded based only on the gatorgrade score.

    "section": "Additional Policies",
    "text": "Additional Policies\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to come to class prepared, on time, and to stay engaged for the duration of the class period. This includes both class and lab sessions. This behavior is core to our shared departmental values and is in addition to the college’s attendance policy.\n\nPreparedness\nComing to class prepared means coming with everything you need to engage in a class session. To satisfy basic expectations of CIS courses, this means, at minimum, that students must:\n\narrive at class with a fully charged laptop\nbring their laptop charger or a battery pack so as to ensure that their laptop works throughout the entire class session\ncomplete any pre-session work such as readings and preparatory assignments\n\n\n\nAttendance and Lateness\nOne missed class or lab session counts as one absence. Coming to class/lab late, leaving early, or missing a large portion of a class/lab session will result in your being marked as “late” to class. Coming to class/lab unprepared may also result in being marked “late”. Being marked “late” to class three times during the course of a semester is equal to one absence.\nExcluding the first week of the semester, students can have five absences without any impact to their grade. These accommodations are meant to cover illness and emergency, so you should always come to class if you are able to do so.\nAs a general guideline, students cannot miss more than two weeks of class in total throughout the academic semester without receiving a letter grade reduction.\nFor this course, excluding the first week and five excused absences, overall course grade will go down by 1/3 of a letter grade for each additional absence or absence equivalence regardless of base grade.\n\n\nEngagement\nThe term “engagement” or our expectation that students remain “engaged” can mean many things, often varying by course. Baseline behaviors that indicate engagement include:\n\nparticipation in class activities and discussions\ndefined contribution to class sessions in full-class or group discussions\nnote-taking (physical or digital)\nparticipating in course session attendance requirements\nnot participating in non-course related activities\nnot completing non-course related projects\n\n\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nThe deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines. This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively.\nAll students in the CIS department are expected to turn in assignments on time. “On time” means on or before the assignment’s due date. This means that an assignment cannot be turned in for credit after a due date, unless the student applies a token.\n\nTokens\nStudents in 101 are allotted four tokens to receive extensions on any assignment except the final with no questions asked by the course instructor except either in the rare cases of documented severe and/or extenuating circumstances or in cases that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.\nA token may be applied via a Google Form up to the assignment deadline, with exceptions granted only for severe and/or extenuating circumstances.\nTokens grant an automatic extension of one week to anything except the final exam.\nToken Form for Automatic Extension\n\n\n\nExtenuating Circumstances\nExtenuating circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, outside of your control, and short-term, like illness and emergency. Regular circumstances associated with taking courses at Allegheny College are not considered extenuating.\nThe accommodations provided by tokens and permitted absences are meant to cover extenuating circumstances like illness, emergency, and work. However, if you have a contagious illness like COVID-19, the flu, or a cold, you should not come to class. If you have expended all your absences and tokens and are still sick with a contagious illness, you may contact your professor about options. If your symptoms are mild or you are recovering from a respiratory illness, we recommend that you wear a mask to class.\nProfessor must be informed of all athletic obligations at the beginning of the semester, or with as much notice as possible. If you are feeling healthy and well, you should make every effort to come to class on time and to complete assignments, rather than using absences and tokens you may need later.\nThese no-questions-asked accommodations are meant to protect student privacy, and to remove the additional effort of acquiring documentation under duress of illness or emergency. In addition, they allow the professor to remain focused on teaching rather than adjudicating excuses.\nIf extenuating circumstances are severe enough to require more absences and tokens, you may contact your professor to discuss options. In most cases, however, a situation of this gravity warrants a request for a “Late Drop” or “Incomplete” in the course, as the student will not have had adequate opportunity to learn the material."

The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following Honor Code pledge:\n\nI hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.\n\n\nEffective Collaboration\nComputer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. The Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not acceptable.\n\nAcceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nDiscussing high-level concepts.\nReferring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs, or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.\nOutlining the high-level steps to solving a problem, without mentioning specific\nlines of code that need to be written.\n\nUnacceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nSharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your source code to someone or looking at someone else’s code.\nCopying someone else’s source code, technical writing, program commands, or program output, even with some slight modifications.\nTyping source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s computer.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism and Artificial Intelligence\nStudents may not pass off or represent the work of another student, or their own prior work, as their own current work in any case. Plagiarism and AI-generatated code, text, or images are not permitted in any assignment type unless the instructions supplied for the assignment explicitly state otherwise.For exams and all other coursework, students are expected to adhere to the given instructions for the particular exam or item of coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to review the authorization specifications on every item and act appropriately, upholding the honor code. Suspected plagiarized or unauthorized use of AI to generate the work that is turned in will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. This policy does not preclude the use of AI to learn."

    "text": "Course Description\nA continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their ability to organize and document a program’s source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations.\nQuantitative Reasoning (QR): Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand, investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.\nScientific Process and Knowledge (SP): Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world; apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.\n\nPrerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.\nDistribution Requirements: QR, SP."

No credit will be awarded for any course work that you submit to the incorrect GitHub repository.\n\n\nAssignment Evaluation\nYou will privately receive a grade for each assignment in Canvas. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed the work that correctly fulfills the assignment’s specification and submitted it by the deadline.\nEngineering Labs are graded based on gatorgrade scores and other criteria.\n\nFifty percent of the grade of each Engineering Lab is determined by the percentage of gatorgrade checks passed.\nOne quarter of the grade is determined by code correctness following a rubric.\nOne quarter of the grade is determined by professional skills and presentation following a rubric. Professional presentation is impacted by linting, formatting, testing, profiling, duplication avoidance, commenting, markdown styling and communication in reflections.\n\nSpec Labs are graded based only on the gatorgrade score.

    "section": "Additional Policies",
    "text": "Additional Policies\n\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to come to class prepared, on time, and to stay engaged for the duration of the class period. This includes both class and lab sessions. This behavior is core to our shared departmental values and is in addition to the college’s attendance policy.\n\nPreparedness\nComing to class prepared means coming with everything you need to engage in a class session. To satisfy basic expectations of CIS courses, this means, at minimum, that students must:\n\narrive at class with a fully charged laptop\nbring their laptop charger or a battery pack so as to ensure that their laptop works throughout the entire class session\ncomplete any pre-session work such as readings and preparatory assignments\n\n\n\nAttendance and Lateness\nOne missed class or lab session counts as one absence. Coming to class/lab late, leaving early, or missing a large portion of a class/lab session will result in your being marked as “late” to class. Coming to class/lab unprepared may also result in being marked “late”. Being marked “late” to class three times during the course of a semester is equal to one absence.\nExcluding the first week of the semester, students can have five absences without any impact to their grade. These accommodations are meant to cover illness and emergency, so you should always come to class if you are able to do so.\nAs a general guideline, students cannot miss more than two weeks of class in total throughout the academic semester without receiving a letter grade reduction.\nFor this course, excluding the first week and five excused absences, overall course grade will go down by 1/3 of a letter grade for each additional absence or absence equivalence regardless of base grade.\n\n\nEngagement\nThe term “engagement” or our expectation that students remain “engaged” can mean many things, often varying by course. Baseline behaviors that indicate engagement include:\n\nparticipation in class activities and discussions\ndefined contribution to class sessions in full-class or group discussions\nnote-taking (physical or digital)\nparticipating in course session attendance requirements\nnot participating in non-course related activities\nnot completing non-course related projects\n\n\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nThe deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines. This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively.\nAll students in the CIS department are expected to turn in assignments on time. “On time” means on or before the assignment’s due date. This means that an assignment cannot be turned in for credit after a due date, unless the student applies a token.\n\nTokens\nStudents in 101 are allotted four tokens to receive extensions on any assignment except the final with no questions asked by the course instructor except either in the rare cases of documented severe and/or extenuating circumstances or in cases that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.\nA token may be applied via a Google Form up to the assignment deadline, with exceptions granted only for severe and/or extenuating circumstances.\nTokens grant an automatic extension of one week to anything except the final exam.\nToken Form for Automatic Extension\n\n\n\nExtenuating Circumstances\nExtenuating circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, outside of your control, and short-term, like illness and emergency. Regular circumstances associated with taking courses at Allegheny College are not considered extenuating.\nThe accommodations provided by tokens and permitted absences are meant to cover extenuating circumstances like illness, emergency, and work. However, if you have a contagious illness like COVID-19, the flu, or a cold, you should not come to class. If you have expended all your absences and tokens and are still sick with a contagious illness, you may contact your professor about options. If your symptoms are mild or you are recovering from a respiratory illness, we recommend that you wear a mask to class.\nProfessor must be informed of all athletic obligations at the beginning of the semester, or with as much notice as possible. If you are feeling healthy and well, you should make every effort to come to class on time and to complete assignments, rather than using absences and tokens you may need later.\nThese no-questions-asked accommodations are meant to protect student privacy, and to remove the additional effort of acquiring documentation under duress of illness or emergency. In addition, they allow the professor to remain focused on teaching rather than adjudicating excuses.\nIf extenuating circumstances are severe enough to require more absences and tokens, you may contact your professor to discuss options. In most cases, however, a situation of this gravity warrants a request for a “Late Drop” or “Incomplete” in the course, as the student will not have had adequate opportunity to learn the material."

    "text": "Honor Code\nThe Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following Honor Code pledge:\n\nI hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.\n\n\nEffective Collaboration\nComputer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. The Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not acceptable.\n\nAcceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nDiscussing high-level concepts.\nReferring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs, or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.\nOutlining the high-level steps to solving a problem, without mentioning specific\nlines of code that need to be written.\n\nUnacceptable forms of collaboration include:\n\nSharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your source code to someone or looking at someone else’s code.\nCopying someone else’s source code, technical writing, program commands, or program output, even with some slight modifications.\nTyping source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s computer.\n\n\n\n\nPlagiarism and Artificial Intelligence\nStudents may not pass off or represent the work of another student, or their own prior work, as their own current work in any case. Plagiarism and AI-generatated code, text, or images are not permitted in any assignment type unless the instructions supplied for the assignment explicitly state otherwise.For exams and all other coursework, students are expected to adhere to the given instructions for the particular exam or item of coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to review the authorization specifications on every item and act appropriately, upholding the honor code. Suspected plagiarized or unauthorized use of AI to generate the work that is turned in will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. This policy does not preclude the use of AI to learn."
