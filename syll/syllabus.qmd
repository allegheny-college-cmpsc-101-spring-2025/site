## Course Description

A continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and
evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve
digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork,
students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance
they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their
ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively
communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory
session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects,
reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations.

**Quantitative Reasoning (QR)**: Quantitative Reasoning is the ability to understand,
investigate, communicate, and contextualize numerical, symbolic, and graphical information
towards the exploration of natural, physical, behavioral, or social phenomena.

**Scientific Process and Knowledge (SP)**: Courses involving Scientific Process and Knowledge
aim to convey an understanding of what is known or can be known about the natural world;
apply scientific reasoning towards the analysis and synthesis of scientific information; and
create scientifically literate citizens who can engage productively in problem solving.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

## Course Components

There are five main components that contribute to the grade in this course.

1. Specifications Labs: Generally shorter labs to be started in lab session and
   completed outside of class. Graded pass/fail and falling in the `remember`,
   `understand`, and `apply` categories of Bloom's Taxonomy.
2. Engineering Labs: Generally longer labs to be started in lab session and
   completed outside of class. Graded by percentage with rubric and falling in the
   `analyze`, `evaluate`, and `create` categories of Bloom's Taxonomy.
3. Quizzes: Questions to be answered in person or through forms online or on
   paper about recently materials, including labs.
4. Participation: Demonstration of effective and collaborative communication in
   Discord by asking or answering questions weekly. Completion of reading and
   reading reports.
5. Attendance. See [section](#attendance-and-lateness) below.

## Assignment Policies

### _Assignment Submission_

All graded components of the course are expected to be turned in on time.

Due dates will be stated in the
[Assignment Deadline Schedule](assignments.qmd)
and [Discord](discord.qmd). Electronic versions of the Engineering and Specification Labs
must be submitted to through a student's GitHub repository created by GitHub
Classroom. No credit will be awarded for any course work that you submit to the
incorrect GitHub repository.

### _Assignment Evaluation_

You will privately receive a grade for each assignment in Canvas. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed the work that correctly fulfills the assignment's specification and submitted it by the deadline.

**Engineering Labs** are graded based on gatorgrade scores and other criteria.

- Fifty percent of the grade of each Engineering Lab is determined by
  the percentage of gatorgrade checks passed.
- One quarter of the grade is determined by code correctness following a rubric.
- One quarter of the grade is determined by professional skills and presentation
  following a rubric. Professional presentation is impacted by linting, formatting, testing, profiling, duplication avoidance, commenting, markdown styling and communication in reflections.

**Spec Labs** are graded based only on the gatorgrade score. A gatorgrade score
of 93% on a given spec lab will result in a grade of 93% for that lab.

---

## Quiz Policies

Quizzes on previously-covered or assigned materials are givin in class, typically on the day following lab.

In case you are **absent** on a day when there is a quiz, you can make it up in any [instructor office hours](#course-description) slot within one week. Reach out if the office hours time slots do not work for you.  

---

## Additional Policies

### _Attendance_

Students are expected to come to class **prepared, on time,
and to stay engaged** for the duration of the class period. This includes both class
and lab sessions. This behavior is core to our [shared departmental values](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/) and is in
addition to the college’s attendance policy.

#### _Preparedness_

Coming to class prepared means coming with everything you need to engage in a class session. To satisfy basic expectations of CIS courses, this means, at minimum, that students must:

- arrive at class with a fully charged laptop
- bring their laptop charger or a battery pack so as to ensure that their laptop
  works throughout the entire class session
- complete any pre-session work such as readings and preparatory assignments

#### _Attendance and Lateness_

One missed class or lab session counts as one absence. Coming to class/lab late, leaving early, or missing a large portion of a class/lab session will result in your being marked as “late” to class. Coming to class/lab unprepared may also result in being marked “late”. Being marked “late” to class three times during the course of a semester is equal to one absence.

Excluding the first week of the semester, students can have **five** absences without any impact to their grade. These accommodations are meant to cover illness and emergency, so you should always come to class if you are able to do so.

As a general guideline, students cannot miss more than two weeks of class in total throughout the academic semester without receiving a letter grade reduction.

For this course, excluding the first week and five excused absences, overall course grade will go down by 1/3 of a letter grade for each additional absence or absence equivalence regardless of base grade.

#### _Engagement_

The term “engagement” or our expectation that students remain “engaged” can mean many things, often varying by course. Baseline behaviors that indicate engagement include:

- participation in class activities and discussions
- defined contribution to class sessions in full-class or group discussions
- note-taking (physical or digital)
- participating in course session attendance requirements
- not participating in non-course related activities
- not completing non-course related projects

### _Late Work Policy_

The deadlines for assignments are hard deadlines. This policy is intended to ensure that students keep up with course topics, are able to actively participate in class, and are accountable for managing time effectively.

All students in the CIS department are expected to turn in assignments on time. “On time” means on or before the assignment’s due date. This means that an assignment cannot be turned in for credit after a due date, unless the student applies a token.

#### _Tokens_

Students in 101 are allotted four tokens to receive extensions on any assignment except the final with no questions asked by the course instructor except either in the rare cases of documented severe and/or extenuating circumstances or in cases that violate the CIS policy document or any College-approved policy.

A token may be applied via a Google Form up to the assignment deadline, with exceptions granted only for severe and/or extenuating circumstances.

Tokens grant an automatic extension of one week to anything except the final exam.

[Token Form for Automatic Extension](https://forms.gle/scmBrKDyFFryfBM5A)

### _Extenuating Circumstances_

Extenuating circumstances are exceptional, unforeseen, outside of your control, and
short-term, like illness and emergency. Regular circumstances associated with taking courses at Allegheny College are not considered extenuating.

The accommodations provided by tokens and permitted absences are meant to cover extenuating circumstances like illness, emergency, and work. However, if you have a contagious illness like COVID-19, the flu, or a cold, you should **not** come to class. If you have expended all your absences and tokens and are still sick with a contagious illness, you may contact your professor about options.  If your symptoms are mild or you are recovering from a respiratory illness, we recommend that you wear a mask to class.

Professor must be informed of all athletic obligations at the beginning of the semester, or with as much notice as possible. If you are feeling healthy and well, you should make every effort to come to class on time and to complete assignments, rather than using absences and tokens you may need later.

These no-questions-asked accommodations are meant to protect student privacy, and to remove the additional effort of acquiring documentation under duress of illness or emergency. In addition, they allow the professor to remain focused on teaching rather than adjudicating excuses.

If extenuating circumstances are severe enough to require more absences and tokens, you may contact your professor to discuss options. In most cases, however, a situation of this gravity warrants a request for a “Late Drop” or  “Incomplete” in the course, as the student will not have had adequate opportunity to learn the material.

## Communications

### _Using GitHub and Discord_

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for collaborative course communication. Communications that are not private matters must take place
in the Data Structures Channel in Discord.

The Allegheny College Computer and Information Science Discord
Server will also have useful announcements about departmental activities
including TL office hours.

### _Using Email_

Although we will primarily use Discord for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails.

---

## Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All
students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following
Honor Code pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

### _Effective Collaboration_

Computer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. The Department of
Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College
encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of
individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own
knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not
acceptable.

- Acceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Discussing high-level concepts.
    - Referring someone to a course text book, course slides, example programs,
      or other resources that contain helpful information or instructions.
    - Outlining the high-level steps to solving a problem, without mentioning specific
    - lines of code that need to be written.

- Unacceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Sharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your
      source code to someone or looking at someone else's code.
    - Copying someone else's source code, technical writing, program commands,
      or program output, even with some slight modifications.
    - Typing source code, technical writing, or commands on someone else’s
      computer.

### _Plagiarism and Artificial Intelligence_

Students may not pass off or represent the work of another student, or their own prior work, as their own
current work in any case. Plagiarism and AI-generated code, text, or images are not permitted in any assignment
type unless the instructions supplied for the assignment explicitly state otherwise.For exams and all other
coursework, students are expected to adhere to the given instructions for the particular exam or item of
coursework. It is the responsibility of the student to review the authorization specifications on every item
and act appropriately, upholding the honor code. Suspected plagiarized or unauthorized use of AI to generate
the work that is turned in will be reported to the Honor Code Committee. This policy does not preclude the
use of AI to learn.

## Educational Accommodations

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student 
Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at 814-332-2898. Student Accessibility 
and Support Services is part of the Learning Commons
and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to
ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.
